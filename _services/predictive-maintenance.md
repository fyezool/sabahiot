Using vast amount of data captured and analysis done in Big Data, predictive maintenace can be done in order to ensure the operation with less downtime.


Ideally, predictive maintenance allows the maintenance frequency to be as low as possible to prevent unplanned reactive maintenance, without incurring costs associated with doing too much preventive maintenance. 

## How does predictive maintenance work?

Predictive maintenance uses condition-monitoring equipment to evaluate an assetâ€™s performance in real-time. A key element in this process is the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT allows for different assets and systems to connect, work together, and share, analyze and action data.
